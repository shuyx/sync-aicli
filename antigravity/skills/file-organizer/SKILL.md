# File Organizer

This skill acts as your personal organization assistant, helping you maintain a clean, logical file structure across your computer without the mental overhead of constant manual organization.

## When to Use This Skill

- Your Downloads folder is a chaotic mess
- You can't find files because they're scattered everywhere
- You have duplicate files taking up space
- Your folder structure doesn't make sense anymore
- You want to establish better organization habits
- You're starting a new project and need a good structure
- You're cleaning up before archiving old projects

## What This Skill Does

1. **Analyzes Current Structure**: Reviews your folders and files to understand what you have
2. **Finds Duplicates**: Identifies duplicate files across your system
3. **Suggests Organization**: Proposes logical folder structures based on your content
4. **Automates Cleanup**: Moves, renames, and organizes files with your approval
5. **Maintains Context**: Makes smart decisions based on file types, dates, and content
6. **Reduces Clutter**: Identifies old files you probably don't need anymore

## How to Use

### Basic Commands

```

```

## Instructions

When a user requests file organization help:

1. **Understand the Scope**
   - Which directory needs organization?
   - What's the main problem?
   - Any files or folders to avoid?
   - How aggressively to organize?

2. **Analyze Current State**

   ```bash
   ls -la [target_directory]
   find [target_directory] -type f | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
   du -sh [target_directory]/* | sort -rh | head -20
   ```

3. **Identify Organization Patterns**

   **By Type**: Documents, Images, Videos, Archives, Code, Spreadsheets, Presentations
   **By Purpose**: Work vs Personal, Active vs Archive, Project-specific
   **By Date**: Current, Previous years, Very old (archive candidates)

4. **Find Duplicates**

   ```bash
   find [directory] -type f -exec md5 {} \; | sort | uniq -d
   ```

5. **Propose Organization Plan** — Always present a plan before making changes

6. **Execute Organization** — After approval, organize with clear logging

   **Important Rules**:
   - Always confirm before deleting anything
   - Log all moves for potential undo
   - Preserve original modification dates
   - Handle filename conflicts gracefully

7. **Provide Summary and Maintenance Tips**

## Best Practices

### Folder Naming

- Use clear, descriptive names
- Avoid spaces (use hyphens or underscores)
- Be specific: "client-proposals" not "docs"
- Use prefixes for ordering: "01-current", "02-archive"

### File Naming

- Include dates: "2024-10-17-meeting-notes.md"
- Be descriptive: "q3-financial-report.xlsx"
- Remove download artifacts: "document-final-v2 (1).pdf" → "document.pdf"

### When to Archive

- Projects not touched in 6+ months
- Completed work that might be referenced later
- Files you're hesitant to delete (archive first)
